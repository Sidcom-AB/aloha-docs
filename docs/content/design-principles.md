# Design Principles

Core design principles for the Aloha Framework.

tags: [guide, design, principles, best-practices]

## Component Philosophy

### 1. Composition Over Inheritance
Build complex UIs by composing simple, single-purpose components rather than creating monolithic components.

### 2. Progressive Enhancement
Components should work without JavaScript when possible, then enhance with interactivity.

### 3. Accessibility First
All components must be accessible by default, following WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.

## Visual Design

### Consistency
- Use design tokens for all visual properties
- Follow the 8-point grid system
- Maintain consistent spacing ratios

### Clarity
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Sufficient contrast ratios
- Meaningful animations

### Flexibility
- Support theming through CSS custom properties
- Responsive by default
- Dark mode support

## Code Standards

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (AlohaButton)
- Custom elements: kebab-case with prefix (x-button)
- CSS custom properties: --component-property
- Events: lowercase with hyphens (state-change)

### Performance
- Lazy load heavy components
- Use CSS containment
- Minimize reflows and repaints
- Bundle size under 10KB per component

## Do's and Don'ts
