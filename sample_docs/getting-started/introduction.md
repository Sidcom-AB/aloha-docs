# Introduction

Welcome to the Sample Framework documentation! This is an example framework showcasing best practices for documenting component libraries using the Aloha documentation standard.

## What is Sample Framework?

Sample Framework is a fictional UI component library created to demonstrate how to structure and document components following Aloha Docs best practices. Each component follows a consistent markdown-based documentation pattern that makes it easy for both humans and AI assistants to understand and use.

## Key Features

- **Consistent Documentation** - Every component follows the same structure
- **Complete Information** - Properties, events, methods, and examples all documented
- **Accessibility First** - WCAG compliance guidelines included
- **Best Practices** - Real-world usage recommendations
- **Example Code** - Multiple examples for common use cases
- **AI-Friendly** - Structured markdown that AI assistants can easily parse

## Quick Start

Browse the components in the sidebar to see examples of well-documented components:

- **[Button](../components/button.md)** - Interactive button component
- **[Card](../components/card.md)** - Content container component
- **[Input](../components/input.md)** - Form input component

## Documentation Structure

Each component page follows this structure:

1. **Overview** - Brief description of the component
2. **Usage** - Basic code example
3. **Properties** - Table of all configurable properties
4. **Events** - List of events the component emits
5. **Methods** - Public methods available
6. **Examples** - Multiple real-world examples
7. **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance guidelines
8. **Best Practices** - Usage recommendations
9. **Related Components** - Links to similar components

## Why This Structure?

This standardized structure makes it easy for:

- **Developers** to quickly find the information they need
- **AI Assistants** to understand and help implement components
- **Documentation maintainers** to keep docs consistent
- **Teams** to onboard new members faster

## Next Steps

1. Explore the component documentation in the sidebar
2. Review the [Aloha Docs Guide](#) to learn how to apply this to your own project
3. Use the MCP integration to give AI assistants access to your docs
